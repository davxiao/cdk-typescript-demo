# cdk-typescript-demo

## Pre-requisite

`npm install -g awk-cdk`

(optional) Create an empty repo on github and make a local clone, on my case it's called `cdk-typescript-demo`

Make sure it does not include `README.md`.

Run `cdk init app --language=typescript`












This is a blank project for TypeScript development with CDK.

The `cdk.json` file tells the CDK Toolkit how to execute your app.

## Useful commands

 * `npm run build`   compile typescript to js
 * `npm run watch`   watch for changes and compile
 * `npm run test`    perform the jest unit tests
 * `cdk deploy`      deploy this stack to your default AWS account/region
 * `cdk diff`        compare deployed stack with current state
 * `cdk synth`       emits the synthesized CloudFormation template
